# Outlook Attachment Downloader Framework

This project provides a Python-based framework for automating the process of downloading email attachments from Outlook, processing files from SFTP, and performing additional file operations such as renaming, data validation, and sending notifications. It is designed to be used in a multi-region setup with configurable schedules and logging.

---

## üìò Overview

The script automates:
- Downloading email attachments from specific Outlook folders.
- Processing files from SFTP servers.
- Performing file operations like renaming, validation, and file type conversion.
- Sending email alerts for missing files.
- Logging all activities with detailed timestamps.

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

The script uses the following dependencies:
- `pyodbc`: For SQL Server database interactions.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `python-dateutil`: For parsing dates.
- `pypiwin32`: For interacting with Outlook.
- `PyYAML`: For reading YAML configuration files.
- `datetime`, `os`, `shutil`, `re`, `logging`, `sys`: Standard Python libraries.

---

## üåç Environment Variables

No specific environment variables are required. Ensure that the following configurations are correctly set in the YAML file and database:
- Region-specific schedules.
- Connection details for the SQL database.
- Outlook folder details.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- **Multi-region support**: Automatically determines the region based on the current time.
- **Outlook integration**: Downloads attachments from specified Outlook folders.
- **SFTP file handling**: Fetches and processes files from SFTP servers directory.
- **File operations**: Renaming, validation, and conversion between file formats.
- **Email notifications**: Alerts for missing files or errors.
- **Logging**: Detailed logs of all activities are stored in the `logs` directory.

---

## üß∞ Prerequisites

### Required Packages
- Python 3.8 or above.
- Required libraries (see dependencies).

### System Requirements
- Microsoft Outlook installed and configured on the system.
- SQL Server ODBC Driver (`ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server`).

---

## üîÑ Function Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Reads configurations from the YAML file.
   - Determines the region (APJ, AMS, EMEA) based on the current time.
   - Connects to the database to fetch region-specific configurations.

2. **Processing**:
   - Handles files based on their type (`Outlook` or `SFTP`).
   - Downloads attachments or fetches files from SFTP.
   - Performs file operations like renaming, validation, and conversion.

3. **Notification**:
   - Sends email notifications for missing files or errors.

4. **Logging**:
   - Logs all activities for traceability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### YAML Configuration
The YAML file contains region-specific schedules, email settings, and other configurations.

Example:
```yaml
APJ_Start_time: 0
APJ_End_time: 8
AMS_Start_time: 8
AMS_End_time: 16
EMEA_Start_time: 16
EMEA_End_time: 24
smtp_server: "smtp.example.com"
port: 587
sender_email: "example@example.com"
receiver_email: "receiver@example.com"
cc_email: "cc@example.com"
base_directory: "C:\\path\\to\\base\\directory"
success: "Process completed successfully."
failure: "Process failed."
```

### SQL Configuration

The script connects to a SQL Server database to fetch region-specific file configurations. Ensure your database contains the `sc360_extraction_config` and `sc360_extraction_process_log` tables.

   - `field_name`: Name of the field to validate data against.
   - `field_value`: List of values (stored as a JSON string) to validate against the field.
   - `archive_path`: Path to the archive folder for processed files.
   - `min_hour`: Minimum hour for processing files in 24-hour format.
   - `max_hour`: Maximum hour for processing files in 24-hour format.
   - `region`: Region identifier (e.g., APJ, AMS, EMEA).
   - `src_file_name`: Name of the source file.

- Example `sc360_extraction_process_log` schema:
  - `file_id`: Unique identifier for the file.
  - `region`: Region identifier (e.g., APJ, AMS, EMEA).
